# Story 1.3 - Metrics Implementation

## Objective
Building on our GitHub data fetching functionality, we will now implement the actual metrics calculation logic. We'll define specific developer metrics that provide meaningful insights into coding activity and habits. These metrics will be calculated from the GitHub data we've already stored in our database and will be displayed on the dashboard.

## Tasks

### 1. Calculate Seniority metric
- [x] **Review to PR ratio**: Review count divided by PR count
- [x] **Review count**: Number of reviews
- [x] **Github account age**: Number of years since account creation
- [x] Calculate seniority score as follows: normalize Review to PR ratio to 3 and multiply by 40. Normalize total reviews to 100 and multiply by 30. Normalize Github account age to 10 and multiply by 30.
- [x] Store the calculated metrics in the database
- [x] Display the calculated metrics on the dashboard


### 2. Calculate Versatility metric
- [x] Fetch the data from the Github GraphQL API needed for calculating this.
- [x] **Language diversity**: Number of distinct programming languages used across commits
- [x] **Contribution type diversity**: Shannon diversity index of contribution types
- [x] **Repository diversity**: Shannon diversity index of repositories contributed to across PRs
- [x] Calculate versatility score as follows: Normalize language diversity to 10 and multiply by 40. Multiply contribution type diversity by 30. Multiply repository diversity by 30. Add these up. 
- [x] Store the calculated metrics in the database
- [x] Display the calculated metrics on the dashboard


### 3. Calculate Productivity metric
- [x] Fetch the data from the Github GraphQL API needed for calculating this.
- [x] **Contribution frequency**: Number of contributions per week on average in the last 1yr
- [x] **Active days**: Number of unique days with some kind of contribution in the last 1yr
- [x] Calculate productivity score as follows: Normalize contribution frequency to 30 and multiply by 50. Normalize active days to 365 and multiply by 50. Add these up.
- [x] Store the calculated metrics in the database
- [x] Display the calculated metrics on the dashboard


### 4. Calculate Code Quality metric
- [x] Fetch the data from the Github GraphQL API needed for calculating this.
- [x] **PR merge ratio**: Percentage of opened pull requests that were merged
- [x] **PR revisions**: Average number of revisions per pull request
- [x] Calculate code quality score as follows: Multiple PR merge ratio by 40. Divide 2 by PR revisions, normalize this number to 1, and multiply by 60. Add these up.
- [x] Store the calculated metrics in the database
- [x] Display the calculated metrics on the dashboard


### 5. Calculate Community Impact metric


### 6. 


### 2. Implement commit related metrics 
- [ ] **Commit count**: Total number of commits
- [ ] **Commit frequency**: Number of commits per week on average
- [ ] **Commit streak**: Longest period of consecutive days with a commit
- [ ] **Language diversity**: Number of distinct programming languages used 
- [ ] **Lines of code**: Total lines of code added and removed
- [ ] **Active days**: Number of unique days with commits

### 2. Implement pull request related metrics
- [ ] **PR count**: Number of pull requests
- [ ] **PR frequency**: Number of pull requests per week on average
- [ ] **PR merge ratio**: Percentage of opened pull requests that were merged
- [ ] **Revisions per PR**: Average number of revisions per pull request
- [ ] **Average PR review time**: Average time between opening and merging a pull request

### 3. Implement review related metrics
- [ ] **Review count**: Number of reviews
- [ ] **Review frequency**: Number of reviews per week on average
- [ ] **Review to commit ratio**: Review count divided by commit count
- [ ] **Review to PR ratio**: Review count divided by PR count

### 4. Implement issue related metrics
- [ ] **Issue count**: Number of issues
- [ ] **Comment count**: Number of comments
- [ ] **Issues closed**: Number of issues closed

### 5. Implement community related metrics
- [ ] **Star count**: Number of stars on their repositories
- [ ] **Fork count**: Number of forks on their repositories
- [ ] **Watch count**: Number of people watching their repositories
- [ ] **Follower count**: Number of followers on their repositories
