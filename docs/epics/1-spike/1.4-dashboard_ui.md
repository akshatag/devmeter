# Story 1.4 - Dashboard UI

## Objective
Clean up the UI and create a more structured user experience. The application will have two distinct pages: a landing page with a single button to fetch data, and a dashboard page that displays the user's metrics with a star plot visualization and a refresh button.

## Implementation Status
The dashboard UI has been implemented with all core features completed. The application now has a clean landing page that redirects to a dashboard if data exists, and a comprehensive dashboard page that displays all metrics with a star plot visualization. The only optional task remaining is the dark/light mode toggle.
