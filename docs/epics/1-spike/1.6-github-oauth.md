# Story 1.6 - GitHub OAuth Implementation

## Objective
Replace the hardcoded personal access token with GitHub OAuth authentication. This will allow users to log in with their GitHub accounts and grant the application permission to access their GitHub data. The application will securely store and manage OAuth tokens for authenticated users.

## Tasks

### 1. Set up NextAuth.js with GitHub provider
- [x] Install required packages: `next-auth` and related dependencies
- [x] Create authentication API routes in `/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`
- [x] Configure NextAuth.js with GitHub provider
- [x] Set up environment variables:
  - `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`
  - `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`
  - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
  - `NEXTAUTH_URL` (for local development: http://localhost:3000)

### 2. Register OAuth application with GitHub
- [x] Go to GitHub Developer Settings > OAuth Apps > New OAuth App
- [x] Configure application:
  - Application name: DevMeter
  - Homepage URL: http://localhost:3000 (for development)
  - Authorization callback URL: http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github
- [x] Store Client ID and Client Secret in environment variables

### 3. Update Prisma schema for authentication
- [x] Modify the User model to include OAuth-related fields:
  - `githubId`
  - `accessToken`
  - `refreshToken` (if applicable)
  - `tokenExpiry`
- [x] Add Account and Session models as required by NextAuth.js
- [x] Run Prisma migration to update the database schema

### 4. Create authentication UI components
- [x] Create a Sign In button component using Shadcn UI
- [x] Add the Sign In button to the home page
- [x] Add sign out functionality

### 5. Update GitHub API utility functions
- [x] Modify GitHub API utility functions to use the authenticated user's token
- [x] Implement token refresh logic if needed
- [x] Add error handling for authentication failures
- [x] Update all API endpoints to work with authenticated user context

### 6. Implement authentication state management
- [x] Create authentication context provider
- [x] Add session handling with NextAuth.js
- [x] Implement protected routes/components that require authentication
- [x] Add loading states for authentication processes

### 7. Test authentication flow
- [x] Test sign in flow with GitHub
- [x] Verify token storage and retrieval
- [x] Test API endpoints with authenticated user
- [x] Ensure proper error handling for unauthenticated requests

### 8. Add documentation
- [x] Document authentication flow
- [x] Update README with authentication setup instructions
- [x] Add comments to authentication-related code
